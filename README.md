## Week 6 — AI for Software Engineering

This module documents the Week 6 assignments focusing on Edge AI, Quantum AI, and practical implementation exercises.

### Folder Structure
- `Part 1/Essay_Answers.md` — Responses for the essay questions covering Edge AI latency/privacy benefits and the role of Quantum AI in optimization.
- `Part 2/Practical_Implementation.md` — Written deliverables for the Edge AI prototype and AI-driven IoT concept.
- `Part 2/Task1_EdgeAI_Prototype.py` — Reference Python script illustrating data preparation, training, TensorFlow Lite conversion, and evaluation steps for Task 1.

### Quick Start
1. Review the essays in `Part 1` for theoretical context.
2. For practical experimentation, open `Part 2/Task1_EdgeAI_Prototype.py` in Colab or a local Python environment with TensorFlow 2.x installed.
3. Follow the deployment and evaluation instructions detailed in `Part 2/Practical_Implementation.md`.

### Requirements Highlights
- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow 2.13+ (or Colab default runtime)
- TensorFlow Lite runtime (for edge simulation)
- Optional: Raspberry Pi 4 (4 GB RAM) for on-device testing

### Notes
- Dataset paths in the prototype script assume the TrashNet dataset has been organized into `train/`, `val/`, and `test/` subdirectories.
- Update credentials and connectivity settings before deploying to physical IoT or edge hardware.
